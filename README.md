# DataJourney
A couple number of Data Analysis Projects(Beginner/Intermediate)

I got invovled with Data after completing the Financial Modeling and Valuation Analyst and Business Intelligence And Data Analyst Course offered by Corportate Finance Insitute in Collaboration with African Leadership Group in November 2022. Since then I have toggled from one project to another in order to keep the knowledge I acquired in shape.
